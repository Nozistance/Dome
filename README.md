### Data Outside Minecraft Environment
The mod supports resource/data packs, world saves, and screenshots

It has an additional configuration menu via ModMenu. Specify the path to the resource/data packs or world save to use them. You can also specify the path to save screenshots.

Usage example: I'm working on a map, and it's convenient for me to have world saves, packs, and screenshots all in the same folder. This makes backups easier
